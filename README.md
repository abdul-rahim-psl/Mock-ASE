# Mock Account Servicing Entity

A simplified bank teller system built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and GraphQL for managing customer accounts, deposits, and transfers. Data is persistently stored in PostgreSQL.

## üìä Database Integration

This application uses PostgreSQL for persistent data storage:

```bash
# Set up the database (see DB-SETUP.md for detailed instructions)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

For detailed database setup instructions, please refer to [DB-SETUP.md](DB-SETUP.md).

## üåê Access Your App Remotely

This project includes localtunnel integration to expose your locally running app to the internet:

```bash
# Start the Next.js dev server and tunnel together
npm run dev:tunnel

# Or start just the tunnel (if your app is already running)
npm run tunnel

# Specify a custom subdomain
npm run tunnel your-custom-subdomain
```

The tunnel URL will be displayed in the console. The integration automatically includes the `bypass-tunnel-reminder` header to avoid interstitial pages.
